# Getting Started

The easiest way to build a new application, without the need to [manually install](#manual-installation) this package, is to use the [Lambda Lambda Lambda VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Nuxy.vscode-lambda-lambda-lambda) which allows you to:

- Scaffold app sources and dependencies.
- Run it locally (in [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers))
- Test code changes in realtime.
- Deploy app sources to AWS.
- Generate [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app)/[Swagger](https://swagger.io) documentation.

## Manual installation

Install package dependencies using [NPM](https://npmjs.com).

    $ npm install lambda-lambda-lambda
