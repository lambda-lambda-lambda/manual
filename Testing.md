# Testing

How you handle this is entirely up to the test framework/runner you're using. For examples using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com), please refer to the [E2E tests](https://github.com/nuxy/lambda-lambda-lambda/tree/master/test/e2e/async) included with this package.
