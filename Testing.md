# Testing

How you handle this is entirely up to the test framework/runner you're using.  For examples using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com), please refer to the [E2E tests](https://github.com/lambda-lambda-lambda/example/tree/master/restfulApiHandler/test) included in the [LÂ³ example](https://github.com/lambda-lambda-lambda/example) application.
