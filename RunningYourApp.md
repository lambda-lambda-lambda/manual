# Running your app

In the VS Code _Command Palette_ choose "Open Folder in Container" which will launch your application in a Docker container allowing for realtime development and testing.  Once launched, the application can be accessed at [http://localhost:3000/&lt;prefix&gt;/](http://localhost:3000/&lt;prefix&gt;/) and tested using the [VS Code Swagger Viewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arjun.swagger-viewer) (`swagger.json`) or by appending `?swagger-ui=html` to any active routes.
